The Licensee can choose in the Order between the different kinds of licenses, i.e. “Standard License” and “Appliance License”, described hereafter.

### 2.1 - Common provisions

Whatever kind of license the Licensee subscribes to, the Licensee shall have no rights other than the ones expressly granted in this Agreement. In particular, the Licensee shall not (and shall not allow any third party to):

* Decompile, disassemble, or otherwise reverse engineer the Software or attempt to reconstruct or discover any source code, underlying ideas, algorithms, file formats or programming interfaces of the Software by any means whatsoever (except and only to the extent that applicable law prohibits reverse engineering restrictions);
* Distribute, sell, sublicense, rent, lease or use the Software for time sharing, hosting, service provider or like purposes;
* Concerning those Licensees who have an Appliance License, Use the Software other than by including all or part of the Software within the Licensee Product, which must have substantially different functionality than the Software;
* Allow any third party to use all or part of the Software for software development or application development purposes;
* Remove any product identification, proprietary, copyright or other notices contained in the Software;
* Publicly disseminate performance information or analysis (including, without limitation, benchmarks) from any source relating to the Software;
* Utilize any equipment, device, software, or other means designed to circumvent or remove any form of Source URL or copy protection used by LoGeek in connection with the Software, or use the Software together with any authorization code, Source URL, serial number, or other copy protection device not supplied by LoGeek;
* Use the Software to develop a product which is competitive with any LoGeek product offerings;
* Use unauthorized Source URLS or keycode(s) or distribute or publish source codes, Source URLs or keycode(s), except as may be expressly permitted by LoGeek in writing. If your unique Source URL is ever published, LoGeek reserves the right to terminate the Agreement without notice.

### 2.2 - Software “Standard License”

In consideration of the payment of the License Fees, and subject to compliance with all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, LoGeek grants the Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-perpetual, non-reusable and limited license to Use the Software for the period (the start date and the duration) and the scope provided for in the Order (the “**(Software) License**”).

The Software License is subject to one or more of the license parameters specified in the Order. 

The Licensee can use the Software only on its own servers and provided these servers are under its sole control. However the Licensee is authorized to Use the Software for providing services the type of “Software as a Service (SaaS)”.

Every entity or organization running the Software on its own servers must have its own license. There is no limit to the number of servers or environments used by that entity or organization.

The Standard License does not allow any distribution rights. Software has an “Appliance License” option which does allow the Licensee to distribute it (see below).

All rights not expressly granted to the Licensee shall be prohibited. The attention of the Licensee is drawn on the fact that it shall not, under a Standard License:

* Modify any part of the Software (except as described in article 3.3 Modifications), create a derivative work of any part of the Software, or incorporate the Software;
* Distribute the Software as part of a product, "appliance" or "virtual server";
* Distribute the Software on any server which is not directly under control of the Licensee.

The Licensee will access the Software source code. The Licensee acknowledges that such access does not change its rights on the Software.

The Licensee may not remove or alter any proprietary rights, trademarks, brands or any other kind of legend that may be embedded in the Software or figure thereon.

### 2.3 - Software “Appliance License” 

Through an “Appliance License”, LoGeek grants Licensee a non-exclusive, non-perpetual, sublicensable, non-reusable, worldwide rights to install, reproduce, Use and further develop Software as an integral part of a Licensee Product. The period (the start date and the duration) and the scope of the Appliance License are specified in the applicable Order.

Sublicensing of Software is only allowed when incorporated with Licensee Product supplied to third party.

Software shall only be incorporated into such Licensee Products as specified in this Agreement.
 
Licensee is prohibited from reselling any Licensee Product in any manner that will infringe this Agreement. Licensee is prohibited from granting its customers permission to use the Software in a manner that contradicts the terms of this Agreement. The third party that acquires a Licensee Product cannot be granted more rights than those granted under the Software Standard License.

LoGeek acknowledges and agrees that (i) Licensee retains all rights, title and interest in and to any Licensee Product, and LoGeek does not acquire any right, title, or interest in or to such Product; and (ii) any integration of Software with Licensee Product shall not affect or diminish Licensee’s rights, title, and interest in and to such Licensee Product. On the contrary, integration of the Software in a Licensee Product does not grant the Licensee other rights to the Software than the ones expressly granted as stated in the first paragraph of this “Software Appliance License” article. 

If Licensee purchases an Appliance License, Licensee may distribute the Software in any Licensee Product  that Licensee develops using the Software in accordance with this Agreement, provided that such distribution does not violate the restrictions set in this Agreement. 

Licensee must not remove, obscure or interfere with any copyright, acknowledgment, attribution, trademark, warning or disclaimer statement affixed to, incorporated in or otherwise applied in connection with the Software. Licensee is required to ensure that the Software is not reused by or with any applications other than those with which Licensee distributes it as permitted herein. For example, if Licensee installs the Software on a customer’s server, that customer is not permitted to use the Software independently of the Licensee Product. 

Licensee must inform LoGeek of Licensee’s knowledge of any infringing use of the Software by any of Licensee’s customers. Licensee is liable for compliance by those third parties with the terms and conditions of this Agreement applicable to the Software Standard License. 

Licensee will not owe LoGeek any royalties for the distribution of the Software in accordance with this Agreement, other than the Appliance License Fees.
