LoGeek shall have sole and exclusive ownership of all right, title and interest in and to the Software and all modifications, versions, Patches, Releases and enhancements thereof (including, without limitation, ownership of all trade secrets, trademarks, brands, logos, and copyrights pertaining thereto), and LoGeek grants limited rights to the Licensee, as specified in this Agreement.

The Licensee must have an active subscription to Use the Software. In case of termination of the Agreement, the Licensee must immediately stop using the Software and comply with the provisions of the article “Termination”.

The Licensee can choose in the Order between the different kinds of licenses, i.e. “Standard License” and “Appliance License”, described hereafter.

### 2.1 - Common provisions

Whatever kind of license the Licensee subscribes to, the Licensee shall have no rights other than the ones expressly granted in this Agreement. In particular, the Licensee shall not (and shall not allow any third party to):

* Decompile, disassemble, or otherwise reverse engineer the Software or attempt to reconstruct or discover any source code, underlying ideas, algorithms, file formats or programming interfaces of the Software by any means whatsoever (except and only to the extent that applicable law prohibits reverse engineering restrictions);
* Distribute, sell, sublicense, rent, lease or use the Software for time sharing, hosting, service provider or like purposes;
* Concerning those Licensees who have an Appliance License, Use the Software other than by including all or part of the Software within the Licensee Product, which must have substantially different functionality than the Software;
* Allow any third party to use all or part of the Software for software development or application development purposes;
* Remove any product identification, proprietary, copyright or other notices contained in the Software;
* Publicly disseminate performance information or analysis (including, without limitation, benchmarks) from any source relating to the Software;
* Utilize any equipment, device, software, or other means designed to circumvent or remove any form of Source URL or copy protection used by LoGeek in connection with the Software, or use the Software together with any authorization code, Source URL, serial number, or other copy protection device not supplied by LoGeek;
* Use the Software to develop a product which is competitive with any LoGeek product offerings;
* Use unauthorized Source URLS or keycode(s) or distribute or publish source codes, Source URLs or keycode(s), except as may be expressly permitted by LoGeek in writing. If your unique Source URL is ever published, LoGeek reserves the right to terminate the Agreement without notice.

### 2.2 - Software “Standard License”

In consideration of the payment of the License Fees, and subject to compliance with all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, LoGeek grants the Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-perpetual, non-reusable and limited license to Use the Software for the period (the start date and the duration) and the scope provided for in the Order (the “**(Software) License**”).

The Software License is subject to one or more of the license parameters specified in the Order. 

The Licensee can use the Software only on its own servers and provided these servers are under its sole control. However the Licensee is authorized to Use the Software for providing services the type of “Software as a Service (SaaS)”.

Every entity or organization running the Software on its own servers must have its own license. There is no limit to the number of servers or environments used by that entity or organization.

The Standard License does not allow any distribution rights. Software has an “Appliance License” option which does allow the Licensee to distribute it (see below).

All rights not expressly granted to the Licensee shall be prohibited. The attention of the Licensee is drawn on the fact that it shall not, under a Standard License:

* Modify any part of the Software (except as described in article 3.3 Modifications), create a derivative work of any part of the Software, or incorporate the Software;
* Distribute the Software as part of a product, "appliance" or "virtual server";
* Distribute the Software on any server which is not directly under control of the Licensee.

The Licensee will access the Software source code. The Licensee acknowledges that such access does not change its rights on the Software.

The Licensee may not remove or alter any proprietary rights, trademarks, brands or any other kind of legend that may be embedded in the Software or figure thereon.

### 2.3 - Software “Appliance License” 

Through an “Appliance License”, LoGeek grants Licensee a non-exclusive, non-perpetual, sublicensable, non-reusable, worldwide rights to install, reproduce, Use and further develop Software as an integral part of a Licensee Product. The period (the start date and the duration) and the scope of the Appliance License are specified in the applicable Order.

Sublicensing of Software is only allowed when incorporated with Licensee Product supplied to third party.

Software shall only be incorporated into such Licensee Products as specified in this Agreement.
 
Licensee is prohibited from reselling any Licensee Product in any manner that will infringe this Agreement. Licensee is prohibited from granting its customers permission to use the Software in a manner that contradicts the terms of this Agreement. The third party that acquires a Licensee Product cannot be granted more rights than those granted under the Software Standard License.

LoGeek acknowledges and agrees that (i) Licensee retains all rights, title and interest in and to any Licensee Product, and LoGeek does not acquire any right, title, or interest in or to such Product; and (ii) any integration of Software with Licensee Product shall not affect or diminish Licensee’s rights, title, and interest in and to such Licensee Product. On the contrary, integration of the Software in a Licensee Product does not grant the Licensee other rights to the Software than the ones expressly granted as stated in the first paragraph of this “Software Appliance License” article. 

If Licensee purchases an Appliance License, Licensee may distribute the Software in any Licensee Product  that Licensee develops using the Software in accordance with this Agreement, provided that such distribution does not violate the restrictions set in this Agreement. 

Licensee must not remove, obscure or interfere with any copyright, acknowledgment, attribution, trademark, warning or disclaimer statement affixed to, incorporated in or otherwise applied in connection with the Software. Licensee is required to ensure that the Software is not reused by or with any applications other than those with which Licensee distributes it as permitted herein. For example, if Licensee installs the Software on a customer’s server, that customer is not permitted to use the Software independently of the Licensee Product. 

Licensee must inform LoGeek of Licensee’s knowledge of any infringing use of the Software by any of Licensee’s customers. Licensee is liable for compliance by those third parties with the terms and conditions of this Agreement applicable to the Software Standard License. 

Licensee will not owe LoGeek any royalties for the distribution of the Software in accordance with this Agreement, other than the Appliance License Fees.

## ARTICLE 3 - REQUIREMENTS, DELIVERY, MODIFICATIONS AND RESTRICTIONS

The Licensee shall:

* Use the Software and all other materials provided hereunder only in accordance with the terms of the License Agreement;
* Promptly install all Releases distributed by LoGeek if applicable and especially if the Release has been provided by LoGeek for security or safety reasons. The Licensee acknowledges that any failure to do so may result in Licensee’s inability to benefit fully from the Software and/or that the Software may operate in a degraded mode. 

### 3.2 - Delivery process

All Software and Documentation shall be delivered by digital means, unless otherwise specified on the applicable Order. Software shall be deemed delivered when it is made available to download by Licensee (“**Delivery**”).

The purchase gets the Licensee unique access credentials for downloading the Software gem. These credentials allow the Licensee to access the Gem Server (bundle install) during the duration of the Agreement. The Licensee must keep these access credentials private.

If LoGeek finds the Licensee access credentials are ever publicized, a request to remove them will be sent via email to the Licensee and the credentials will be revoked. LoGeek reserves the right to permanently remove access and terminate the Agreement for cause if the situation happens again.

### 3.3 - Modifications

#### 3.3.1 - Modifications to the Software

LoGeek shall provide the Licensee with source code so Licensee can create modifications to the original Software (“**Modifications**”). Modifications include but are not limited to: 
* Any addition to or deletion from the content of a file included in the Software or previous Modifications created by Licensee; or
* Any new file that contains any part of the Software or previous Modifications.

Should Licensee create any Modification, Licensee shall inform promptly LoGeek of such Modification and shall put at LoGeek’s disposal such Modification.

Licensee hereby assigns to LoGeek the most extensive intellectual property rights in relation to the Modifications. The rights so assigned include the rights of use, reproduction, modification and distribution. They are assigned to LoGeek and its licensees and successors free of charge, on a worldwide basis and for the longest period of legal protection. These rights are assigned on a non-exclusive basis, Licensee retaining the right to freely make use of the said Modifications.

Such assignment of rights is governed not only by the paragraph hereabove but also by the Contribution License Agreement. By signing the Agreement, the Licensee agrees with the terms of the Contribution License Agreement.

#### 3.3.2 - Modifications to the open source version of the Software

Following the signing of this Agreement, and for as long as this Agreement is valid, the terms corresponding to the license purchased by the Licensee and object of this Agreement may be extended, at the discretion of the Licensee, to the version of the Software as put by LoGeek in the open source community.

It is the Licensee’s responsibility to inform Logeek in the event the Licensee decides to Use the open source version of the Software under the terms of this Agreement. 

Should the Licensee make such a decision, any Modifications to the open source version of the Software will be subject to the provisions of the article “Modifications to the Software”.

### 3.4 - Third party programs or libraries

The Software may include third party software programs or libraries that are subject to open source, freeware or other commercial licenses and/or notices that LoGeek is required to distribute with the Software. These licenses and notices are available to the Licensee in files in the Software directory, in documentation that accompanies the Software or via a supplementary list provided by LoGeek. The Licensee shall comply with these agreements and notices. 

This Agreement does not modify any rights or obligations that the Licensee may have under the third party licenses and notices applicable to such programs. Any use of such program is subject to the rights and obligations under the applicable license.

## ARTICLE 6 - LIMITED WARRANTY

IN SO FAR AS PERMITTED BY LAW, THE SOFTWARE SHALL BE DELIVERED “AS IS” WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OR GUARANTEE WHATSOEVER, WRITTEN OR ORAL, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. LOGEEK EXPRESSLY DECLINES ANY IMPLICIT WARRANTY OR GUARANTEE REGARDING COMMERCIAL QUALITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, PERFORMANCE, AND/OR SUITABILITY FOR A PARTICULAR USE.

LOGEEK IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE RESULTS OBTAINED FROM THE USE OF THE SOFTWARE.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL LOGEEK BE HELD LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF COMMERCIAL OPPORTUNITY, LOSS OF DATA, INTERRUPTION OF WORK, BODILY HARM, OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, FORTUITOUS, CONSECUTIVE, OR DAMAGE OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER RESULTING FROM THE USE, THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF USING, OR RESULTS OF THE USE OF THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF LOGEEK WAS INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. THE USE OF THE SOFTWARE BY THE LICENSEE SHALL BE ENTIRELY AT ITS OWN RISKS AND PERILS. SHOULD THE SOFTWARE BE FOUND DEFECTIVE, THE LICENSEE SHALL BEAR ALL COSTS FOR SERVICING, REPAIRS, OR CORRECTIONS AND, IN SO FAR AS ALLOWED BY LAW, THE LICENSEE SHALL UNCONDITIONALLY RENOUNCE ALL RIGHTS, LEGAL OR OTHERWISE, IT MAY HAVE AGAINST LOGEEK FOLLOWING SUCH FAULTS OR DEFAULTS.

## ARTICLE 7 - INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY WARRANTY

LoGeek warrants the Licensee that the delivery of the Software shall not infringe any intellectual property (copyright, patent right, trademark right) of any third party.

LoGeek shall indemnify and hold the Licensee harmless from and against any third party claims and/or actions and/or proceedings relating to any item provided by LoGeek to the Licensee, based on an infringement of intellectual property rights, and shall bear, subject to the provisions of the article “Liability”, all related definitive damages and indemnities which may result from such claims and/or actions and/or proceedings in relation to this Agreement, provided that: (i) the Licensee promptly notifies LoGeek in writing of the claim, action or proceeding and provides LoGeek with all information useful for defending its interests; (ii) the Licensee agrees that LoGeek shall have sole and exclusive control of the defense of the claim, action or proceeding, should LoGeek so desire and (iii) the Licensee makes no admission or statement of any kind whatsoever that may prejudice LoGeek’s defense. 

The indemnification referred to in this section is limited to the payment by LoGeek of all damages and costs finally awarded for the claim, based on the demonstration of a counterfeit exclusively under LoGeek’s responsibility, or settlements costs approved in writing by LoGeek.

If the Software infringes a third party’s intellectual property right or if LoGeek reasonably believes it is likely to infringe a third party’s intellectual property right, LoGeek may, at its discretion (i) procure the right for the Licensee to continue using the Software or (ii) replace or modify the Software and to make its use non-infringing.

If LoGeek cannot do either of the above, LoGeek or the Licensee may terminate automatically and without judicial formalities this Agreement (ipso jure) subject to LoGeek reimbursing the Licensee the residual value of the non-compliant Software purchase price, with prorata temporis amortization over a maximum period of three (3) years from the date the Software was delivered.

The foregoing warranty does not apply (i) if the Software has been altered, modified, customized, except by LoGeek; (ii) in case of unauthorized use of the Software or of use of the Software in excess of the License Software granted to the Licensee; (iii) to any unsupported Release of the Software or if the Licensee does not use the latest Release provided by LoGeek or (iv) to any open source software or to any other third party code embedded in the Software which may be subject to specific terms and conditions provided to the Licensee.

The preceding provisions set LoGeek’s liability limits with respect to the Licensee with regard to intellectual property rights infringement. Therefore, LoGeek shall not provide any guarantee other than that described in the present article regarding counterfeit.
