2.5.0 (to be released)
------------------------

- Transform's `close` can now yield rows. This is useful to write "aggregating transforms", such as sorting, grouping etc. See [#57](https://github.com/thbar/kiba/pull/57) for more background & explanations.

2.0.0
-----

Please review the [release notes](https://github.com/thbar/kiba/releases/tag/v2.0.0) if you plan to use the StreamingRunner.

- New (opt-in) StreamingRunner allows class transforms to generate more than one row. See [#44](https://github.com/thbar/kiba/pull/44) for rationale & how to activate.
- Potentially breaking change if you were using the internal class `Kiba::Parser` directly: ETL jobs parsing has been modified to improve the isolation between the evaluation scope and the Kiba classes. See [#46](https://github.com/thbar/kiba/pull/46) for more information.
